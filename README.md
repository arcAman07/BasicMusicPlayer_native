# BasicMusicPlayer_native (Work in Progress)
A Basic Music player native application that allows the user to change the volume of the audio(using seekbars and audio managers), play &amp; pause and and go back and forth in the audio using a timer.

Future Integrations:
1) Allow users to put in their favourite audio tracks(sort of a playlist).
2) Users sharing their playlists with other peers.
3) Better UI(user-interface).
4) Integration of this audioPlayer with Spotify and exploring the limits of this application.
